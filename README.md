# ⚡Greetings!⚡

My name is Dima, I’m currently studying Computer Science, but my main interests are Data Science and Data Analytics, especially in fields of _Urban Transportation_ and _Intelligent Transportation Systems_. I love to find insight into data and hidden relations between its features.

My favorite equation is the Bayes' theorem $$\text{❤️}P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\text{❤️}$$

## 🔬 Current Projects 

- Right now, I'm a part of a research project in my university where we assess and quantify the safety of bicycle infrastructure.
    - We do a lot of cool stuff like computer vision video analysis from dashcams and sentiment analysis with topic modeling!
- I have a personal project that takes Steam profile information and turns it into a list of interesting facts about user’s preferences. The work on it has been postponed because of the previous point.
- I’m also analyzing different small datasets for fun all the time!

## 📖 Things I'm learning right now
- [Julia](https://julialang.org) for scientific computing
- Urban logistics and modeling/simulation of such
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) for low-level and efficient computing
- Distributed computing
