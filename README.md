# 🪐Hey! Nice to see you!✨
My name is Dima, I’m currently studying Computer Science, but my main interests are Data Science and Data Analytics. I'm especially interested in fields of _Urban Transportation_, _Intelligent Transportation Systems_, and everything else that makes smart cities come to life!🚆🚌🚲

My favorite equation is the Bayes' theorem and my favorite distribution is lognormal.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    
$$\text{❤️}P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\text{❤️}$$

## 🔬 Current Projects 

- Right now, I'm a part of a **research project** in my university where we assess and quantify the safety of bicycle infrastructure.
    - We do a lot of cool stuff like **computer vision** video analysis from dashcams and **sentiment analysis** with topic modeling!
- I do presentations and events in my university as part of student organizations. Currently in progress:
    1. "Intro to Julia programming" workshop.
    2. "intro to cryptography" workshop and small competition.
- I’m also analyzing different small datasets for fun all the time!

## 📖 Things I'm learning right now
- [Julia](https://julialang.org) for scientific computing.
- Urban logistics and modeling/simulation of such.
- Visualization systems.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) for low-level and efficient computing.
- Distributed computing systems.
