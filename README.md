# ⚡Greetings!⚡

My name is Dima, I’m currently studying Computer Science, but my main interests are Data Science and Data Analytics, esspecially in fields of _Urban Transportation_ and _Intelegent Transportation Systems_. I love to find insight into data and hidden relations between its features.

## Current Projects

- Right now, I'm a part of a research project in my university where we assess and quantify the safety of bicycle infrastructure.
    - We do a lot of cool stuff like computer vision video analysis from dashcams and sentiment analysis with topic modeling!
- I have a personal project that takes Steam profile information and turns it into a list of interesting facts about user’s preferences. The work on it has been postponed because of the previous point.
- I’m also analyzing different small datasets for fun all the time!

## Things I'm trying to learn
- [Julia](https://julialang.org) for scientific computing
- Urban logistics and modeling/simulation of such
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) for low-level and efficient computing
- Distributed computing

## Skills
- Python 3 and it's libraries
  - pandas
  - NumPy
  - SciPy
  - MatPlotLib/Seaborn
  - scikit-learn
- Mathematical Analysis
  - Statistics
      - Probabilistic AI algorithms like Bayesian Networks and HMMs
  - Geometric analysis (Calculus)
  - Linear algebra
- Software development
  - C/C++
  - Data Structures
  - Computer Systems
