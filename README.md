# 🪐Hey! Nice to see you!✨
My name is Dima, I’m currently studying Computer Science, but my main interests are Data Science and Data Analytics. I'm especially interested in fields of _Urban Transportation_, _Intelligent Transportation Systems_, and everything else that makes smart cities come to life!🚆🚌🚲

My favorite equation is the Bayes' theorem and my favorite distribution is lognormal.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    
$$\text{❤️}P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\text{❤️}$$

</div>

  <summary>🔎 More about me</summary>

- I live on planet Earth, Sol system in Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy. 🌍

- I'm an avid reader, and while I don't have a "favorite" book, you definetely need to read [*A Brief History of Time* by Stephen Hawking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3869.A_Brief_History_of_Time?ref=nav_sb_ss_3_6).

- I love sci-fi, futuristic technology, and all stuff thats science in general.

- My first-ever programming language was C++, I didn't have good time with it, but I don't regret it.

- If I encounter anything in my life that can be calculated, you bet I already have spreadsheets open.
