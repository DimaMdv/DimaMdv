# ü™êHey! Nice to see you!‚ú®
My name is Dima, I‚Äôm currently studying Computer Science, but my main interests are Data Science and Data Analytics. I'm especially interested in fields of¬†_Urban Transportation_,¬†_Intelligent Transportation Systems_, and everything else that makes smart cities come to life!üöÜüöåüö≤

My favorite equation is the Bayes' theorem and my favorite distribution is lognormal.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    
$$\text{‚ù§Ô∏è}P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\text{‚ù§Ô∏è}$$

## üß™ Current Projects 

- Right now, I'm a part of a **research project** in my university where we assess and quantify the safety of bicycle infrastructure.
    - We do a lot of cool stuff like **computer vision** video analysis from dashcams and **sentiment analysis** with topic modeling!
- I do presentations and events in my university as part of student organizations. Currently in progress:
    1. "Intro to Julia programming" workshop.
    2. "intro to cryptography" workshop and small competition.
- I‚Äôm also analyzing different small datasets for fun all the time!
